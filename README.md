# CSE360
CSE360 at ASU with Ang-Wanek

CSE360 Semester-Long team project with 4 other members.

The team was to create an interactive JavaFX application for a customer and restaurant owner to use. The owner is able to create an account and add and remove items to a menu. The customer is able to create an account, add desired menu items to a cart and checkout items, create and cancel orders.

For the entire project, I was in charge of the UI. I created the overall aesthetic and layout of each page that the user iteracts with.
